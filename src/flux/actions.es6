/*
Public: In the Flux {Architecture.md}, almost every user action
is translated into an Action object and fired globally. Stores in the app observe
these actions and perform business logic. This loose coupling means that your
packages can observe actions and perform additional logic, or fire actions which
the rest of the app will handle.

In Reflux, each {Action} is an independent object that acts as an event emitter.
You can listen to an Action, or invoke it as a function to fire it.

*# Action Scopes

N1 is a multi-window application. The `scope` of an Action dictates
how it propogates between windows.

- **Global**: These actions can be listened to from any window and fired from any
  window. The action is sent from the originating window to all other windows via
  IPC, so they should be used with care. Firing this action from anywhere will
  cause all listeners in all windows to fire.

- **Main Window**: You can fire these actions in any window. They'll be sent
  to the main window and triggered there.

- **Window**: These actions only trigger listeners in the window they're fired in.

*# Firing Actions

```coffee
Actions.queueTask(new ChangeStarredTask(thread: @_thread, starred: true))
```

*# Listening for Actions

If you're using Reflux to create your own Store, you can use the `listenTo`
convenience method to listen for an Action. If you're creating your own class
that is not a Store, you can still use the `listen` method provided by Reflux:

```coffee
setup: ->
  @unlisten = Actions.didPassivelyReceiveNewModels.listen(@onNewMailReceived, @)

onNewMailReceived: (data) ->
  console.log("You've got mail!", data)

teardown: ->
  @unlisten()
```
