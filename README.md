**N1 is an open-source mail client built on the modern web with [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/).** It is designed to be extensible, so it's easy to create new experiences and workflows around email. N1 is built on the Nylas Sync Engine, which is also [open-source free software](https://github.com/nylas/sync-engine).
