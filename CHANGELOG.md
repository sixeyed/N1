  + Search now correctly displays results returned from your email provider (#750).

    APIs receive a DOM tree of the draft body so no HTML string manipulation is necessary.

  + In Preferences > General, a new option allows you to clear your local cache
    and / or reset your accounts in N1.
  + In Preferences > General, a new option allows you to disable spellcheck.

### 0.4.14 (3/10/16)

  + Overhauled Sidebar: The sidebar now shows more accurate contact information,
    recent conversations with the selected participant, and more.

  + Themes: A brand new theme picker (in the Application Menu) allows you
    to quickly try different themes, and we've bundled two great community themes
    (Darkside and Taiga) into the app! An updated dark theme is coming soon.

- Fixes:
  + Warnings now appear in the main window if we are unable to connect to your email provider.
  + The Send Later, Snooze and read receipts plugins now alert you if you are not using our hosted infrastructure.
  + The Autoload Images and Snooze date input field is now locale-aware.

      before your message was sent.
    + The emoji picker now matches emoji against more common words, like `:thumbsup`!
    + Link tracking correctly modifies only `http://` and `https://` links
    + When sending two responses to the same email, the second email no longer appears
      to be sending in some scenarios.

  + Reading:
    + Messages now show a loading indicator while they're being downloaded, and you can
      retry if the download is interrupted.
    + The "Sent" view now orders your messages by "last sent message".
    + The "At 2:30PM, Mark wrote..." byline is now recognized as part of quoted text.
    + Deleted messages are filtered from the conversation view, and you can show them by
      clicking "Show Deleted   Messages." Threads in trash and spam are also excluded from
      the Starred and Gmail label views.
    + "Archive" no longer removes the label you are currently viewing.
    + Delete and backspace no longer follow Gmail's "remove from view" behavior.
      For Gmail's behavior, use the `y` shortcut.

  + Attachments:
    + Downloads that fail are now retried properly when you interact with them.
    + Changing an attachment name when saving it no longer clears the file extension.

    + The "Welcome to N1" screens now emphasize that it is cloud-based.
    + You can use IP addresses as IMAP / SMTP and Exchange domains.

    + N1 now displays better error messages for a wide variety of auth issues.
    + Themes are no longer applied in the account setup window.

- Temporary:
  + N1 no longer syncs Drafts with Gmail, avoiding several critical issues our
    platform team is working to resolve. (Drafts duplicating or appearing sent as you edit.)

- Cleanup:
  + All sample plugins have been converted from CoffeeScript to ES2016.
  + The `<Popover>` component has been deprecated in favor of `<FixedPopover>` which is more flexible.
  + Running specs from the application no longer resets your account configuration.

### 0.4.9 (2/25/16)

[Read about this release on Medium](https://medium.com/@Nylas/nylas-n1-now-has-snooze-swipe-actions-emoji-and-more-561cd1e91559)

- Features:

  + Snooze: Schedules threads to return to your inbox in a few hours, a few days,
   or whenever you choose.

  + Swipe Actions: In the thread list, swipe to archive, trash or snooze your mail.
    Swiping works with the Mac trackpad and with Windows / Linux touchscreen devices.

  + Send Later: Choose “Send later” in the composer and pick when a draft should be sent.
    These scheduled drafts are sent via the sync engine, so you don’t need to be online.

  + Read Receipts and Link Tracking: Get notified when recipients view your message
    and click links with new read receipts and link tracking built in to the composer.

  + Emoji Picker: Type a `:` in the composer followed by the name of an emoji to
    insert it into your draft.

- Design:

  + This release includes slimmer toolbars and new icons in the composer.

  + Font sizes throughout the app have been made slightly smaller to match platform
   conventions. Like it the old way? Use the zoom feature in Workspace preferences!

  + The N1 icon is now more of a "sea foam" green, which helps it stand out among
    standard system icons, and features a square design on Windows.

  + Tons and tons of additional polish.

- Developer:

  + A new `MetadataStore` and `model.pluginMetadata` concept allows plugins to associate
    arbitrary data with threads and messages (like snooze times and link IDs).

- Many, many other bug fixes were incorporated into this release. Take a look at
  closed GitHub issues that made it into this release here:

### 0.4.4 (2/5/16)

We're really excited to announce this release - the largest improvement to N1
since the initial release in October!

- Features:
 + Unified Inbox: The conversation view has been rebuilt so you can read and
   triage mail from all your accounts at once. In addition to the Inbox, we've
   unified Search, Drafts, Sent, Trash, and more.

 + Send and Archive: You can now choose Send and Archive when replying to threads.
   More "Send variants" are coming soon, including Send Later and Undo Send, and
   you can choose a default in Preferences.

 + Account Sidebar: We've rebuilt the account sidebar to address your feedback:
   + Rename folders and labels by right clicking / double clicking
   + Re-order accounts from Preferences > Accounts
   + See unread counts for all accounts when viewing "All Accounts"
   + Collapse label and folder views

 + Send As: You can now choose which account or alias a new draft should be sent
   from, and choose a default account in Preferences > Sending.

 + Launch On System Start: N1 can now launch in the background via an option in Preferences.

 + Search: You can now archive / trash items in the search results view.

 + Contact autocompletion is now unified, uses dramatically less memory, and does
   not depend on the selected account

 + Outbox: N1 now keeps mail it isn't able to send in your Drafts folder, and
   sends when you reconnect to the internet.

- Performance:
 + The conversation list has been rebuilt using a brand new "live query"
   API that yields great performance and minimizes costly database queries.
 + The conversation list data source no longer requires an accurate item count,
   removing frequent and expensive count queries.

  + `AccountStore.current()` has been deprecated and replaced with the concept of
    "Mailbox Perspectives" which are views of mail data.
  + Developer > Toggle Screenshot Mode now allows you to hide text in the app to
    take a screenshot.
  + `window.eval` has been disabled in N1. (Issue #1159)

- Fixes:
  + On Mac OS X, N1 no longer crashes when you change language or spellcheck preferences.
  + When viewing all accounts, the tray icon and dock icon also display
    the unified unread count.
  + You can now make N1 the default mail client on Windows.
  + You can now re-order mail rules and use "starred" as a rule criteria.
  + You can now authenticate IMAP / SMTP accounts where the username is not the
    email address. (Fixed in the Nylas Sync Engine.)
  + The maximum width of the account list has been increased.
  + And many, many, many other fixes!

- Coming Soon:
  + Our PR has landed in Electron, unblocking Swipe to Archive.

### 0.3.45 (1/21/16)
