# Filing an Issue

Thanks for checking out N1! If you have a feature request, be sure to check out the [open source roadmap](http://trello.com/b/hxsqB6vx/n1-open-source-roadmap). If someone has already requested
the feature you have in mind, you can upvote the card on Trelloâ€”to keep things organized, we
often close feature requests on GitHub after creating Trello cards.

If you've found a bug, try searching for similars issue before filing a new one. Please include
the version of N1 you're using, the platform you're using (Mac / Windows / Linux), and the
type of email account. (Gmail, Outlook 365, etc.)

# Contributing to N1

The hosted sync engine allows us to control adoption of N1 and maintain a great
experience for our users. However, the sync engine is
[open source](https://github.com/nylas/sync-engine) and you can set it
up yourself to begin using N1 immediately. Follow instructions on the [sync
engine](https://github.com/nylas/sync-engine) repository.

### Getting Started

Before you get started, make sure you've installed the following dependencies.
N1's build scripts and tooling use modern JavaScript features and require:

 - Node 6.0 or above with npm3
 - python 2.7

Linux users on Debian 8 and Ubuntu 15.04 onward must also install libgcrypt11
and gnome-keyring.

Next, clone and build N1 from source:

    git clone https://github.com/nylas/N1.git
    cd N1
    script/bootstrap

Read the [getting started guides](https://nylas.github.io/N1/getting-started/).

**Building Nylas on Windows? See the [Windows instructions.](https://github.com/nylas/N1/blob/master/docs/Windows.md)**

### Running N1

    npm start

### Testing N1

    npm test

This will run the full suite of automated unit tests. We use [Jasmine 1.3](http://jasmine.github.io/1.3/introduction.html).

It runs all tests inside of the `/spec` folder and all tests inside of
`/internal_packages/**/spec`

You may skip certain tests (temporarily) with `xit` and `xdescribe`, or focus on only certain tests with `fit` and `fdescribe`.

### Linting N1

N1 lints clean against eslint, coffeelint, csslint, lesslint, and our own internal
tool, nylaslint. To run the linters, just run `npm run lint`.

### Creating binaries

Once you've checked out N1 and run `script/bootstrap`, you can create a packaged
version of the application by running `script/build`. Note that the builds
available at [https://nylas.com/N1](https://nylas.com/N1) include licensed
fonts, sounds, and other improvements. If you're just looking to run N1, you
should download it there!


# Pull requests

We require all authors sign our [Contributor License
Agreement](https://www.nylas.com/cla.html) before pull requests (even
minor ones) can be accepted. (It's similar to other projects, like NodeJS
Meteor, or React). I'm really sorry, but Legal made us do it.

### Commit Format

We decided to not impose super strict commit guidelines on the community.

We're trusting you to be thoughtful, responsible, committers.

We do have a few heuristics:

- Keep commits fairly isolated. Don't jam lots of different functionality
  in 1 squashed commit. `git bisect` and `git cherry-pick` should still be
  reasonable things to do.
- Keep commits fairly significant. DO `squash` all those little file
  changes and "fixmes". Don't make it difficult to browse our history.
  Play the balance between this idea and the last point. If a commit
  doesn't deserve your time to write a long thoughtful message about, then
  squash it.
- Be hyper-descriptive in your commit messages. I care less about what
  you did (I can read the code), **I want to know WHY you did it**. Put
  that in the commit body (not the subject). Itemize the major semantic
  changes that happened.
- Read "[How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)" if you haven't already (but don't be too prescriptivist about it!)
